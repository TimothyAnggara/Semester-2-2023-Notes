What is the purpose of the chi-square test of independence and when to sue it compared to chi-square test of homogeneity. Also please help explain the null hypothesis for the indenepence
Answer: Two variables are independence of one another in independence. In homogeneity we are looking at different different 
- What is the purpose of the chi-square test of independence
- What is the null hypothesis and altenrative hypothesis of the test of indencdence.

What is the difference between fisher's exact test and the goodness of fit test?
- Works for both independence and 
What is the purpose of a monte carlo test?

Since the sign test and the wilcoxon sign test have the same assumptions, when should we use one over the other?

Can I use the wilcoxon sign test to similar to a one sample t-test / two sample t-test?
- Wilcoxon sign test is used similarly to a one-sample / paired t-test (sure)
- Wilcoxon rank-sum test is used similarly to a two-sample t-test (sure)

- With permutation test, if there are ties use normal distribution

What is the residual sum of squares and what does it mean?
- Residualsa re the differences between the group means and that observation which that group comes from
What is the treatment sum of sqaures and what does it mean?
- The distance between the group means and the overall mean

What's the difference between 
- Monte carlo we fix the row and column totals and fill in the grid
- Permutation test, pool all the observations together and then put them into the treatment groups number

Tukey's
- same sample size
- exact
- x

What are the differences between permutation testing, bootstrapping, and Monte Carlo testing?
- permutation testing is when you're trying to explore the entire space of permutation
When do we use permutation?



When we are doing a wilcoxon test and we have ties, what is our test statistic?
