## Lecture 4 -
- When to use Fisher's Exact test vs Monte Carlo
	- You can always use the monte carlo test
	- Fisher can only be used for 2 x 2 test
- In Fisher's Exact test and Monte Carlo test, we are testing for independence / homogeneity in a $r \times c$ contingency table
- What is the hypergeometric distribution, specifically,
$$
\small{P(Y=y)=\frac{{\displaystyle\binom{y_{1 \bullet}}{y}}{\displaystyle\binom{n-y_{1 \bullet}}{y_{\bullet 1}-y}}}{\displaystyle\binom{n}{y_{\bullet 1}}}},
$$
- I don't understand how the fisher's exact test work, it says we're going to be using the hypergeometric distribution but we are just using combinatorics to find the t-values and then the p value?
- 
- When are the cases we shouldn't use the Yates correction
- What is the null hypothesis for ficher and monte carlo?
	- It should be fine if the odds ratio is equal to one?
