What are the assumptions for using the bootstrapping method?
- No symmetric or distributive assumptions on the data
- Similar to a permutation test but no 
- Indepence
- How much variance is present in our statistic we ar elooking at
Can we use any test for the bootstrapping method?
So a contrast is a linear combination where the coefficients add up to 0 and in the ANOVA context, the linear combination of means sums up to 0?
$$
\sum^{i=g}_{i = 1} c_i\mu_i = 0
$$

In slide 10 of lecture 21, it says that under the ANOVA null hypothesis population contrasts are zero:
- Does this mean that all of $c_i = 0$?
- Or that the sum = 0

On this slide, it says that the ANOVA null hypothesis may be too strong?
- I don't quite understand why it would be too strong?
- This special contrast, is it something we figure it out? and this coefficients must sum to 0?

For the ANOVA specific test, what is the null hypothesis?
