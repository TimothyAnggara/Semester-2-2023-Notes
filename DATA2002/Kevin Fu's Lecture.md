## Semester in a nutshell
- Module 1: Categorical Data
	- Controlled vs Observational studies
	- Goodness of fit
	- Performance measures
	- Relative risk, odds
	- Test of homogeneity / Independence
- Module 2: Testing Means
- Module 3: Testing many means
- Module 4: Lerning and prediction

## Module 1
- Why should we care about hypothesis testing, estimation, and prediction
- We are unable to collect information about the entire population

## Important Points
Sensitivity is always 1 - false negative rate
Specificity = 1 - false positive rate
- We use fisher's exact test when table expected cell count is less than 5
- We can also use monte carlo test when table expect cell count is less than 5
