## Software Development Models - Teams
### Waterfall Model - Teams
| Development Activities                                       | Teams                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Divide the work into stages                                  | Separate team of specialists for each stage                                 |
| Each stage, work is passed from one team to another          | Coordiation is required for the handoff from team to team using "Documents" |
| End of all stages, you have a software product ready to ship | As each team finishes, they are assigned to a new product                   |                                                                          |

### Teams under different Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models
In a traditional structure teams works by dividing tasks into pieces that should be more-or-less independent
- Specialist teams
- Project management and resource reallocation
- Clear authority lines so disagreements can be resolved
Problems with the traditional structure is:
- Single point of failure
- Inflexibility
- Lack of feedback
#### The Agile Manifesto Revisit
Recall that in the Agile Manifesto, it prioritizes individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan
Agile values individuals and interactions over processes and tools because:
- People tend to follow processes blindly and make mistakes
- "A great tool can sometimes help people to do the wrong things faster"
- Tools or best practices are not enough - people who need to use it should buy into it to realize its benefits
- People needs to see the value of following certain practices
#### Agile Principles - People
- Build projects around **motivated individuals** and give them the environment and support they need
	- **TRUST** them to get the job done
	- Most efficient and effective method of conveying information within a development team is face-to-face conversation
	- A team reflection meeting to become more effective and adjust their behavior at regular intervals is a good idea
- Business **people** and **developers** must **work together daily** throughout the project
	- The best architectures, requirements, and design emerge from self-organizing teams
	- Highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software

### Teams - Individuals and Collaboration
A common problem experienced in a software development team is that they "throw it over the wall"
- "Throw it over the wall" meaning they "throw" their part tot he next team without much communication or collaboration
- Team members are busy thinking about their own work than the entire project
- If teams are working in isolation without proper communication, it creates divide thus killing collaborations

#### Agile Teams - Individual Practices
When teams are trying to adopt Agile principles as a cohesive unit, members may only sometimes choose to adopt those practices that directly relate to their specific roles
- Developers - Concentrate on automated testing and automated build systems
- Team leads - Task boards to allocate and track work
- Stakeholders - Defining requirements 
While adopting Agile practices can lead to improvement in those specific areas but there can be situations where the gains are offset by a lack of cohesion in the team's overall Agile approach

## Team Dynamics
Team dynamics are the unconscious, psychological forces that influence the direction of a team's behavior and performance. Factors that lead to team dynamics:
- Personalities and work styles
- Knowledge and skills
- Organization culture and structure
- Cultural differences, Background
### Team Dynamics - Good or Bad?
In Agile development, team dynamics can be a good or a bad thing
- Can improve overall team performance
	- Productive conflict
	- Different perspectives
- Can lead to unproductive conflict that can demotivate and percent team from achieving its goals
#### Tuckerman Team Development Model

### Team Dynamics - Identification and Resolution
Team dynamics are the result from the interaction of many factors
- Personalities, work style, roles, culture, organizational structure
In team dynamics its important to investigate root causes of conflict or poor team performance
- Structured interviews or informal chats in private is a good way to identify and resolve problems 
Identify potential improvements
- Change in office layout, team development workshops

### Agile Teams - Skills
Its claimed that agile teams work with the best developers but that isn't necessarily the case
- Every project needs at least one experienced and competent lead person
	- Critical Success Factor
- Each experienced and competent person on the team permits the presence of 4-5 "average" or learning people
- With that skill mix, agile techniques have shown to work many times

### Effective Teamwork
- Teamwork comprises of the right tools, people, and practices
- Effective teamwork is everyone's shared responsibility
- In large software organizations, teams involve many roles across many different departments
- Team building activities are used to build effective teams
### Team Building
- Various types of activities used to enhance social relations and define roles within teams, often involving collaborative tasks
- There is evidence how team building affect positively team effectiveness
#### Team Building Activities
- **Goal Setting**: Emphasis on the importance of clear objectives and goals
- **Interpersonal Relations**: focus on teamwork skills such as giving and receiving support, communication, and sharing information
- **Standup Meetings**
- **Roles and Responsibilities** 

#### Roles and Responsibilities
- Define roles and responsibilities that will make your team successful
	- We can define these roles by creating a table of responsibilities
- Clarify expectations as a team
- Helps move a team from "storming" to "norming", or help "performing" teams to get back on trac

How can we set what roles and what responsibilities to assign?
- Identify Roles
	- Team lead, Developers, Designers
	- Coarse-grained
	- Add to the role's column
- Clarify own responsibilities
	- Think of top 3-5 tasks in priority order
	- Write on sticky notes
- Think of teammate's responsibilities
	- Write 1-2 responsibilities for each role from your prespective
	- Write responsibilities you may think that don't have a clear owner
- Refine and Consolidate (Optional)
	- Talk to teammates with similar roles are refine responsibilities
- Discuss all roles
	- Role owner(s) describe their role and palce sticky notes in own responsibility column
	- Other teammate's role description in the other column
	- Owner to accept/decile the responsibilities by other teammates
- Summarize roles and responsibilities
	- All to agree
	- Owner to document and fill skill gaps
#### Table of responsibilities
| name | Role | Responsibility (own) | Responsibility (Others) |
| ---- | ---- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
|      |      |                      |                         |
|      |      |                      |                         |
|      |      |                      |                         |
### High-Performing Agile Teams
- Cross-functional; 
	- Engineers, Designers, Architects, Sales
- Mutual Respect and Mutual Responsibility
	- Not blaming culture or "throw it over the wall"
- Sound engineering practices
	- Tools and Automation
- Value and belief of agile practices and principles
- Apply agile practices effectively as individuals and as a team
- Remove continuous training and team monitoring/coaching

## Tools and Technologies for Teamwork
### Issue Tracking System
A software that managers and maintains lists of issues and create update and resolve said reported issues internally or externally

#### Bug (defect) Tracking System: 
- keeps track of reported software bugs in software development projects
- Centralized overview of development requrest and their states
- Assigned a priority, status, severity, or complexity
- Priorized list of pending items
- integrated with other tools or software management systems

### Bugzilla - Bug Tracking Tool
An open source web based bug tracker and testing tool by Mozilla Project
- Bug or feature request that can be submitted by anyone and will be assigned to a particular developer
- Various Status updates for each bugs
	- Bugzilla allows the public to file bugs
	- Assigns all bugs to a gatekeeper whose jobs is to assign responsibility and priority level
