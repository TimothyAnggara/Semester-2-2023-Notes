- Professional Development
	- Enhance your own professional development and that of your staff
- Professionalism
	- Enhance the integrity of the ACS and the respect of its members for each other

#### Professional Frameworks - IEEE CS
- Public: Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest
- Client and employer: Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in best interest of client and employer, consistent with the public interest
- Product: Software engineers shall ensure their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standard possible
- Judgment: Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment
- Management: Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance
- Profession: Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest
- Colleagues: Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest
- Self: Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession
#### Professional Frameworks - ACM
- General Ethical Principles
	- Society and human well-being, avoid hard, be honest and trustworthy, be fair, respect work, respect privacy, and honor confidentiality
- Professional Responsibilities
	- More specific aspects including quality of work and processes, quality of reviews and judgement, competence
- Professional Leadership Principles
	- Leadership roles including quality of work, training, and competence
#### ACM Professional Responsibilities
- Strive to achieve high quality in both the processes and products of professional work â€“ Maintain high standards of professional competence, conduct, and ethical practice 
- Know and respect existing rules pertaining to professional work. 
- Accept and provide appropriate professional review. 
- Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks 
- Perform work only in areas of competence. 
- Foster public awareness and understanding of computing, related technologies, and their consequences 
- Access computing and communication resources only when authorized or when compelled by the public good. 
- Design and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure

### Privacy
- ACM Professional Responsibility
	- Access computing and communications resources only when authorized or when compelled by the public good
		- Individuals and organizations have the right to **restrict access to their systems and data** so long as the restrictions are consistent with other principles in the Code
		- Computing professionals should not access another's computer system, software, or data without a reasonable belief that such an action would be authorized or a compelling belief that it is consistent with the public good
	- "A system being publicly accessible is not sufficient ground on its own to imply authorization. Under exceptional circumstances a computing professional may use unauthorized access to disrupt or inhibit the functioning of malicious systems; extraordinary precautions must be taken in these instances to avoid harm to others"
### Product Liability
- "the area of law in which manufacturers, distributors, suppliers, retailers, and others who make products available to the public are held responsible for the injuries those products cause"
- Is computer software a product or a service?
	- As product (code) with with license
	- Software as a Service; buy subscription
	- Australian Consumer Law (ACL) lists computer software as a good
#### Software Liability - Software Engineers
- Software vendors liable for software failures/defects?
- Are software developers liable for defects in their software?

- Software is a product, maybe strict liability or negligence
- Software is a service, generally not liable
- Software engineers should have ethical responsibilities, be competent in doing their job, communicate any issues they may observe with their managers

## Intellectual Property
### Intellectual Property (IP)
- A category of property that includes intangible creations of the human intellect
- IP is intangible
	- Challenging to protect - How to protect a software or design
- IP law to protect people and business' intellect
	- Economic incentives that lead to innovation and technological development
#### Types of IP
- Copyright
	- Grant a creator of an original work exclusive right to itt
	- Source code, executable code, database, artistic work
	- Granted automatically in Australia but not in all countries
	- Does not protect ideas or methods employed
- Trademarks
	- Sign, design, or expression which distinguishes products or services
	- Formal registration and require meeting certain criteria
- Trade Secrets
	- Process, formula, practice, design, pattern, which is unknown and provide a competitive advantage
#### Intellectual Property (IP) - Patents
- A form of IP which grants inventor(s) the right to exclude other from making, using, or selling, and important an invention for a limited time in exchange for public disclosure of the invention
- Inventor(s)
	- Exclusive rights to the inventor (usually 20 years)
	- Freedom to exploit the invention
- Public:
	- Enrich body of knowledge and innovation
- For an item to be patentable, an invention must be:
	- New
	- Non-obvious
	- Useful
	- Disclose of the invention in the patent application must meet certain formal and substantive standards
- A patent is granted for an invention as a solution to a technical problem
- Local protection (IP Australia) vs International protection (WIPO/PCT)

## Licensing
- "Official Permission to do or use something"
- Software software vendors be liable for software failures/defects?
- A software license can solve this problem by outlining:
	- What you are responsible for?
	- What software can/cannot do?
	- Permissions, conditions, liability, etc.
- A licensor grants a license to authorize a use to licensee:
	- Copyrighted software or patented invention
	- Nature of use
	- Condition of use
	- Duration of use
	- Return to licensor

## Open-source Software
### What is Open-source Software?
- Open-source: "Something people can modify and share because it is design to be publicly accessible"
- Open-source software: "Software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance"
- "Closed-source" or "proprietary" software is the oppsoite

### Open-source vs Free Software
- Free software refers to liberty of use, not price
	- Run, copy, study, change, distribute, and improve source code
- 4 Essentials of Freedom
	- Run the program as you wish for any purpose
	- Study how the program works, and change it as you wish
	- Redistribute copies of the original program
	- Redistribute copies of the modified versions
#### The Open-source Initiative (OSI)
- Maintains the definition and trademark
- Approves open-source licenses

#### Open-source Software - License
- Terms of license but legally different from proprietary software
	- Copyleft licenses; must also release modified source code
	- How to use, study, modify, and distribute software
	- Generally, permission to use for various purposes
	- Promote collaboration and sharing
- A proprietary software has a legally different license agreement

## Licensing
### Open-source Software- License Types
- Under the OSI, there are many open-source licenses approved
- Here we will look at:
	- MIT
	- Apache
	- Mozilla
	- GNU Affero General Public License
	- GNU General Public License
	- GNU Lesser General Public License
	- The Unlicense
