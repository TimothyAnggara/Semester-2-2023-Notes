## Sources of Market Failure
1. Market Power
	- Monopoly, monopolistic competition, oligopoly
	- Raises price and restricts output relative to a competitive market
2. Price Ceilings and floors
3. Taxes and Subsidies
	- With a tax or a subsidy, the amount paid by the consumer $\neq$ amount received by producers / firms
4. Public goods
	- Goods for which one persons consumption does not detract from another's consumption or enjoyment of the good
		- Defense, Police, Roads, etc.
		- Generates a free rider problem
5. External costs and benefits ('Externalities')
	- Cost imposed on agents other than the consumers or producers of the good
		- Pollution
		- Public education
		- Talking in lectures
	- Marginal benefit and marginal cost curves do not reflect total or society's benefits / cost

## Government Interventions
Here, we'll consider two common types of government intervention:
- Price regulations
- Taxes and Subsidies
Here, we will assume that the market is efficient in the absence of government intervention
- Market is a competitive market without market failure
In this scenario, we'll examine how government interventions affects market price, quantity traded, and welfare in the market
### Price Controls or Regulation
- Usually enacted when the market price is deemed 'unfair'
	- Minimum Wages
	- Public housing
	- Agricultural price support schemes
- Price Floor - Establishes a minimum price at a good which is sold
	- Not binding if set below the equilibrium or market clearing price
	- Leads to an excess supply if it is binding
#### Price Floors
- A binding price floor cause an excess supply of the good
- Creates a welfare loss
- Non-price rationing means determine who gets to sell the good or service

#### Price Ceilings
- A legally established maximum price at which a good can be sold
- A price ceiling is not binding if it is set above the equilibrium or market clearing price
- Non-price rationing means determined who gets to buy the good or service
- Oppositely of a price floor, it creates a shortage instead of excess
- It also creates a welfare loss
- Can lead to 
	- Queues
	- Discrimination by sellers or government
	- Black markets (side payments)

#### Efficiency with a Price Ceiling
- Implementation of the price ceiling restricts the use of price to allocate a good
	- Advantage of a using the market to allocate the good and services produced is that consumers who value the product most highly get the goods
- With all alternative allocation methods, it is possible that the good is allocated to consumers who  do not value the good most highly
	- This can further reduce total surplus generated in the market
### Taxes and Subsidies
- A **TAX** is a compulsory payment made tot he government
- A **SUBSIDY** is a payment made by the government to an individual or firm
- Taxes and subsidy drive a wedge between the price paid by buyers and the price received by sellers
	- If a tax is imposed, buyer pay more  than sellers receive
	- If a subsidy is imposed, buyers pay less than sellers receive
- Effectively have two prices when there are taxes
	- Buyers respond to post-tax prices
	- Sellers respond to pre-tax prices
- Why have taxes and subsidies?
	- To raise revenue
		- Finance government services
	- Correct market failures
		- Carbon tax
	- Provide income support
		- Age pension, student payments
- Types of Taxes
	- Excise tax or specific tax or per-unit tax
		- Each bottle of alcohol can have a $3 tax
		- A tax that is applied per volume of alcohol
	- Ad valorem tax or proportional tax
		- GST
		- A tax that is applied as a percentage of something
	 - Taxes on buyers 
		 - Stamp duty - When you buy property you need to pay something to the government
	- Taxes on sellers
		- GST, Alcohol tax

### Incidence of Taxation On Sellers
- Describes who bears the economic burden of taxation
	- In general, the economic burden falls party on the buyer and partly on the seller
- The economic burden of taxation is distinct from the legal requirement to pay the tax
- It will shift the supply curve up
- Lets consider the specific tax or per-unit tax
![[Pasted image 20231016115206.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231016115238.png]]
- We can see that the burden that is borned by the tax is shared among the buyers and sellers
	- Buyers now have to pay at price $P_t$ and the sellers only get to keep $P_s$
![[Pasted image 20231016115631.png]]
- Purple - Consumer surplus
	- Consumer surplus is now the area above $P_t$ and below the demand curve
- Green - Producer surplus
	- Producer surplus is the area below $P_s$ and above the supply curve
- Blue - Tax revenue
	- Tax revenue is the rectangle between $P_t$ and $P_s$ at the quantity traded $Q_T$
![[Pasted image 20231016120049.png]]
### Incidence of Taxation on Buyers
- It actually doesn't matter if the taxation is put on buyers or sellers
	- The result in the market is actually the same
- Now let us consider what happens if we impose the tax on buyers
	- This causes to shift the demand curve down vertically by the amount of tax
![[Pasted image 20231016121043.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231016121228.png]]
- The taxation on buyers shifts the demand curve down
- The equilibrium point is not ($P^*, Q_T$)
- The buyers have to buy $P_B$ and the sellers only get the keep $P_T$

### Incidence of Taxation
- The burden of the tax falls on the more inelastic side of the market
	- The more inelastic the supply, the more seller pays (of the tax)
	- The more elastic the supply, the more the buyer pays
	- The more inelastic the demand, the more the buyer pays
	- The more elastic the demand, the more the seller pays
- Lets consider perfectly elastic supply 
	- Buyer pays all the tax or bears the full economic burden
- Lets consider perfectly inelastic supply
	- Seller pays all the tax or bears the full economic burden
- The case where the demand or the supply curve is perfectly elastic or inelastic, both the buyer and seller share the burden

## Deadweight Loss from Taxation
- Consider how a tax creates a deadweight loss
- Assume that the tax is imposed on sellers
- Example
	- Demand curve $Q^D = 180 - 2P$
	- Supply Curve: $Q^s = P$
	- Tax = $15
![[Pasted image 20231016123153.png]]
- Deadweight loss = $\frac{(65-50) \times (60-50)}{2} = 75$

## Determinants of Deadweight Loss
- Size of the deadweight loss will depend on change in market / equilibrium output that comes about as a result of the tax
- In general, the more elastic are supply and demand
	- The larger the reduction in quantity traded
	- Larger the DWL
![[Pasted image 20231016124328.png]]
- A tax creates a DWL because it induces buyers and sellers to change their behavior compared to the market outcome with no tax
- The market 'shrinks'
- In general, the DWL increases more rapidly than the tax
	- Doubling the size of tax leads to a quadrupling of the DWL
![[Pasted image 20231016124501.png]]
## Subsidies
- Subsidies are really just negative taxes and as a result the analysis of subsidies is similar to taxes
	- Drives a wedge between price paid by buyers and price received by sellers
	- Moves the market outcome away from the competitive equilibrium
	- Creates a DWL
- Let us consider a subsidy paid to producers
![[Pasted image 20231016124814.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231016124823.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231016124831.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231016125301.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231016124844.png]]
- A subsidy to producers would reduce the marginal cost hence shifting the supply curve down
	- This would shift the equilibrium down
		- Buyers now pay at $P_T$ 
		- Sellers now keep $P_S$
	- But this will result over production which will result in a deadweight lossx`
