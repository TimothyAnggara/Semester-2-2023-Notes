## Monopoly and Pricing Strategies
- So far, we have assumed a monopolist charges a single price
	- Same price for every item of a good sold
	- But some consumers are happy to pay more and some customers can only buy is price is lower
- Price discrimination - Practice of selling the same food at different prices to different customers
- To price discriminate,
	- A firm needs market power
	- It needs to be able to prevent arbitrage (or prevent resales)
	- Needs some information about different customers and their WTP
### Pricing Strategies
- Consider some of the following behaviors
1. A firm sells a software program to Max users at a higher price than Microsoft Users
2. A firm sells standard and extended versions of software
3. Discounts to bulk purchasers
4. Two pieces of software are offered to a consumer together at a lower price than each separately

#### Reminder: What is market Power
- Using these pricing strategies requires the firm to have a degree of market power
- Recall that Market Power captures the idea that a firm can raise its prices without the loss of all its customers

## Price Decimations
### First Degree Price Discrimination
- Monopolist knows each consumer's willingness to pay and charges each consumer exactly their willingness to pay
- As a result, perfect price discrimination, The monopolist:
	- Extracts all the consumer's surplus 
		- Monopolist gets all the surplus in the transaction
	- Sells to all consumers with WTP $\geq$ MC: All mutually beneficial trades take place thus no DWL 
- Not very implementable because they require knowledges of WTP of each customer
	- Rare in practice but most likely in one-on-one bargaining
	- May be increasing with technology (Amazon, Google, etc.)

#### One way of Perfectly Price Discriminating
- Two-part tariff
	- Charges consumers two distinct fees
		1. A fixed fee $F$
		2. A per-unit fee $p$
	- The fixed fee can be an access fee, membership fee, or joining fee, price of an essential element of the product
	-  Per-unit fee is a fee per unit that the consumer consumes
- To profit maximize:
	1. Monopolist sets the per-unit price as $p = MC$ and
	2. Charges all the potential consumer surplus as the fixed fee $F$
- This method only works if all consumers are identical;

### Third-Degree Price Discrimination
Monopolist can separate consumers into '**markets**' which charges a difference price in each market
- E.g. A market in Australia and a market in the US
	- A monopolist can charge one price in Australia and another price in the US
- E.g. Movie tickets - concessions
	- Students vs Full price tickets

Note that in third-degree price discrimination, the information and arbitrage requirements are less stringent than first-degree price discrimination
	- Monopolist needs to have a way to identify the market that any particular individual belongs to
	- Monopolist needs to prevent arbitrage between markets but not within a group inside of the same market

The intuition for this price discrimination is to charge a higher price to a more price-inelastic segment of the market to segment with higher WTP
- How does the monopolist set prices in each market?
	- Monopolist will equate MR = MC in each market and will charge the monopoly price to each group

#### Worked Example
- Consider one type of consumer with demand: $p_a = 10 - Q_a$
- Consider another type of consumer with demand: $p_B = 9 - Q_B$
- Assume MC = 2
- What price should be place on the two type of consumer?

- For $p_A$:
	- $TR = 10Q_a - Q_A^2$
	- $MR = 10  - 2Q_A$
	- $10-2Q_A = 2$
	- $Q_A = 4$
	- $P_A = 6$
- For $p_B$
	- $TR = 8Q_B - Q_B^2$
	- $MR = 8  - 2Q_B$
	- $8-2Q_B = 2$
	- $Q_B = 3$
	- $P_B = 5$
- Total Profit
	- $TR_A + TR_B - TC = Profit$
	- $4 \times 6 + 3 \times 5 - (4+3) \times 2 = 25$
	- Profit = 25

### Second Degree Price Discrimination
- Consumers have different willingness to pay but it is UNobservable to the monopolist
	- In a market, there may be high-value and low-value consumers, but the monopolist does not know which group any person belongs to
- The monopolist 'sorts' the different consumers by offering different packages / versions of a good
	- Consumers choose a package based on their WTP
#### Second-Degree Price Discriminations Examples
Consider the following valuations (WTP) placed on software by different type of buyers (Business, Personal) and the alternative pricing option (Standard, deluxe)

|          | Business | Personal |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Standard | $35      | $20      |
| Deluxe   | $100     | $20      |
- Assume: the cost of production of software is zero; buyers choose the version that gives them the highest consumer  
surplus.  
- Ideal outcome – charge a price of $100 for the deluxe version to business and $20 for standard to personal buyers. 
	- Total profit of $120. All CS converted into profits. 
- If PD=$84 and PS=$20, personal buyer buys standard and business buys deluxe (CS from deluxe is $16 and CS from standard is $15). 
	- Total profit $104.  
- If PD=$86 and PS=$20, both personal buyer and business buys standard (CS from deluxe is $14 and CS from standard is $15). 
	- Total profit $40  
- If PD=$100 only (single price), Personal buyer doesn’t buy and business buys deluxe. 
	- Total profit $100  
- If PS=$20 only (single price), Personal buyer and business buy standard. 
	- Total profit $40

## Monopolistic Competition
A monopolistic competition is a market structure where many firms sell products that are similar but not identical with these characteristics:
- Many Sellers
- Product Differentiation
	- Each firm has some market power with a downward sloping demand curve
	- The demand curve is rather price elastic
- Free entry and exit of firms in the long run

### Monopolistic Competition in the Short Run
- Firm in monopolistic competitive industry faces a downward sloping demand curve
	- Profit Maximizing Rule: MR = MC
	- Price determined by demand curve; Price consistent with quantity set
- Firm can earn short-run economic profit
- Firm produce less than capacity -- Lower output than the level that minimizes average total cost

### Monopolistic Competition in the Long Run
- In the long run, profits provide an incentive for new firms to enter the market
	- Leads to an increase in supply of differentiated products in the market
	- Reduces demand for all incumbent firms
		- Entry causes shifts in firm's demand curve to the left
- If firms are making losses in the long run, some firms will leave the industry
	- Leads to decrease in supply of differentiated products in the market
	- Increases demand for all incumbents
		- Demands shifts to the right for firms that are still in the industry
	- Continues until no more economic losses
	-
