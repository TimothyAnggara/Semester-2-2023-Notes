## Outline
- Functioning Markets
- Demand + Supply -> equilibrium
- Market equilibrium, quantity traded
- Welfare analysis: benefits from trade
	- Surplus for consumers and sellers (firms)
### Market Equilibrium
A market is in **equilibrium** if the market price and the quantity demand by consumers equals the quantity supplied by firms in the market
- The price where this occurs is called the **market-clearing price** ('equilibrium price')

If a market is NOT in equilibrium, there will be pressure on price and quantity to move towards the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity
- If the price is higher, then the companies have more supply than the customers can afford so they have surplus of inventory thus having to decrease price to maximize profit which will move the price and quantity closer to the equilibrium price
- If the price is lower, then the consumers have more demand than what the company could supply so the company has to increase the price thus pressuring to the current points to the equilibrium point

### Comparative Static Analysis
Markets are affected by a **change or event** beyond the direct control of buyers or sellers in the market
- We want to analyze how that **change or event** affects the choices of firms / consumers in the market and how those choices affect **market outcomes**

### Example: Car Market with an Increase in Steel Price

	- Note that there will be a movement along the demand curve because the price of the car increases

### Welfare - The  Benefits to Market Participants
Markets are one of the main ways that goods and services are produced and distributed

Consumers and firms will only participate in markets if it is **beneficial** to them and we can measure and observe changes in the benefits to these participants using **welfare analysis**
- They are better off from trading

### Consumer Surplus
A consumer surplus is the welfare consumers receive from buying units of a good or service in the market

We measure a consumers surplus by evaluating the net value (net benefit) of a good or service
- Consumer's willingness to pay - price paid

An individual's consumer surplus is by calculating the area between the individual demand curve and the price line. Similarly, we can find the consumer surplus for all consumers by calculating the area between the market demand curve and the price line

What happens if there is a decrease in price? What would happen to the consumer surplus?
![[Pasted image 20230828114355.png]]
If the price falls from $P_1$ to $P_2$, the CS (Consumer Surplus) increases from $A$ to $A+B+C$ due to:
- The price drop (That what the $B$ area represents)
- More quantity because the consumers wants to buy more because of the lower price(That was the $C$ area represents)

### Producer Surplus
Producer surplus is the welfare producers receive form selling units of a good or service in the market
- Producer surplus is measured by considering the net benefit of selling a good or service
	- Cost of production - unit of good / service bought

A firm's producer surplus is calculated by the area between the price line and the firm's supply curve and we can find the PS (Producer Surplus) of all producers in the market by calculating the area between price line and market supply curve

What happens if the market price increases from P1 to P2?
- PS increases from $A$ to $A+B+C$ because of:
	- Increased price which means more benefit per unit (Area $B$)
	- Increased price means more can be sold thus more benefit (Area $C$)

### Total Surplus
We can also measure total welfare of all the participants in the market
- Here, we are only thinking about two types or participants, consumers and producers

With only consumers and producers, the total surplus is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus in the market equilibrium:
$$
TS = CS + PS
$$

### Welfare & Pareto Efficiency
The Pareto efficient is saying that if it is not possible to make someone better off without making someone else worse off
- A scenario is not *Pareto efficient* if it is possible to reallocate resources to make someone better off without making someone worse off

Another way to think about Pareto efficiency is that we are trying to maximize total surplus

In a competitive market, resources are allowed based on supply and demand, thus will reach an equilibrium point where it is not possible to make someone better off without making someone else worse off
- It is not possible to change the level of output and make at least one person better off without making anyone worse off

Note that the Pareto efficiency does not imply either uniqueness or fairness/equity
