## Background - Different market structures
We will look at 4 different types of markets in turn:
- Perfectly competitive markets
	- Markets have many buyers and sellers, low barriers to entry and an identical product
	- Firms do not have market power to set prices
- Monopoly Markets
	- A market with one seller with high barriers of entry and the power to choose its price
- Monopolistically-competitive markets
	- Many firms selling slightly differentiated products
	- These sellers have scope to set their own prices but low barriers into entry
- Oligopoly Markets
	- Markets only having a few firms
	- Strategic interaction between these firms is critical to the outcome in these markets
		- Actions by a firm are dictated by the actions of other firms in the market

## Characteristics of Perfect Competition
Perfectly competitive markets have the following characteristics:
- Many buyers and sellers
	- All buyers and sellers are a small part of the total market
- Homogeneous products
	- Consumers indifferent who they purchase from
	- All firms have access to the same technology
- Price takers
	- No individual buyer or seller have sufficient market power to influence market prices
- Free entry and exit
	- Firms can freely enter and exit the market in the long run

## The Supply Curve in Perfect Competition
- Short Run (SR)
	- Each firm's plant size is given
		- Some inputs are fixed
	- Hence the number of firms is fixed
- Long Run (LR)
	- Each firm can change the size of its plant
		- All inputs are caried
	- Firms can enter and exit the industry, hence the number of firms is variable

### Supply in the Short Run
- If a **firm produces output**, its **supply curve** is given by its **marginal cost curve**
- If a firm chooses not to produce output in the short run, we say that the firm **shuts down**

#### Short-Run Supply Decision for a Firm
In the short run, the firm should only take into account its variable costs as its fixed cost are sunk
- Hence, we can derive the shut-down condition that a firm will shut down in the short run if total revenue is less than variable cost
$$
TR < VC
$$
- We can divide shutdown condition by the level of output $q$ to yield:
$$
TR/q < VC/q \ or \ p<AVC
$$
- So we can see that if price falls below the average variable cost, a firm will shut down
	- Recall that a firm that does produce a positive output chooses its output in accordance with its supply curve that is its Marginal Cost curve until P = MC
		- Note that the MC curve intersects AVC curve at its minimum
- Thus the shut-down rule for a competitive firm is:
$$
P < AVC_{MIN}
$$
- On the other hand, a firm will supply a **positive quantity**:
$$
P \geq AVC_{min}
$$
- Hence a firm's short-run supply curve is its MC curve that lies above $AVC_{min}$

### Market Supply in the Short Run
In the short run, there is **no entry or exit of firms** in the competitive market
- A firm is prevented from exiting the market by its fixed cost
	- A firm can shut down (not produce) but not exit
- No new firms can enter the short run
Thus, the number of firms is fixed in the short run which will result in the short-run market supply a horizontal summation of the individual firms' supply curves

### Profits and Losses in the Short Run
In a competitive market, it is possible for firms to make profits, break even, or incur losses in the short run
- A firm is making a loss if total revenue < total cost
	- $P < ATC$
- A firm is making a profit if total revenue > total cost
	- $P > ATC$
Note that a firm will be willing to continue to sell in the short run when making a loss provided that $P > AVC_{min}$ because a firm by producing you still create extra revenue to help pay for its fixed cost

## Supply in the Long Run
- Recall that in the long run all input variables are variable
	- Firms can exit a market and new firms can start operating in a market
	- Existing firms can alter their factory size
- In the long run, there is free entry and exit of firms 
- Firms will enter or exit the market depending on its (anticipated) level of economic profit or loss
- The market will reach its** long run equilibrium** when there is no longer any entry into or exist from the market
	- When firms are making zero (economic) profit

### Firm Supply: Exit/Entry Decision
- With free entry and exit in the longer, a firm choose to exit incurs no costs
	- Unlike in the short run where the fixed cost would incur a cost
- Hence, a firm will chose to exit the market if its total revenue is less than its total cost
	- A firm will exit if $P < ATC_{MIN}$
- A firm's long-run supply curve is the section of its MC that lies above (LR) $ATC_{MIN}$

## Firm's Long Run Supply Curve

## Elimination of Profits and Losses
In a long run, firms can enter or exit a market depending on whether they are going to make a profit or a loss
- When firms are profitable ($P > ATC_{min}$), new firms will want to **enter** the market
	- New firms will shift the short-run market supply curve to the right, causing equilibrium price downwards
	- New firms result in more supply
	![[Pasted image 20230911225640.png]]
- When firms are sustaining losses ($P < ATC_{min}$), firms will exit the market
	- Shifts the short-run supply curve left, pushing the equilibrium price upwards as firms leave the industry
	- Less firms result in less supply

## Long Run Equilibrium
Because of the free exit and entry of firms, price will tend to decrease when it is above the average total cost and increase when it is below the average total cost
- Thus price will equal ATC in the long run
Because firms supply curve cuts at ATC at its minimum, the long-run market price will be $P = ATC_{min}$
- As price equals ATC, a competitive firm will make **zero (economic) profit** in the long run
![[Pasted image 20230911230327.png]]
## Market Supply Curve in the Long Run
Because of the long run, price will adjust itself back to the minimum average total cost no matter what the quantity traded in the market is.
- This will result in the long-run industry supply curve to be horizontal at $ATC_{min}$
- An industry with a perfectly elastic long-run industry is called a constant-cost industry
	- Unless stated, a competitive industry is assumed to be a constant-cost industry

## Dynamics in the Long Run
- In a short run,  an unanticipated increased in demand in the short run will increase prices and the firms will increase their output to make positive economic profits
- In a long run, because of the unanticipated increase in demand, the entry of new firms will result in prices to go back down to $ATC_{min}$ and each firm will again sell at its equilibrium quantity and economic profits will be 0
![[Pasted image 20230911231336.png]]
## Constant-cost Industry
- In a constant-cost industry, entry and exit in the long run ensures that all firms earn zero profits and the price is equal to the minimum average total cost
- This assumes that all firms have access to the same technology and have the same cost structure, and this cost structure does not change as the industry grows.
- A constant-cost industry will look like the figure shown above

## Increasing Cost Industry
In some cases, the long-run industry supply curve will not be perfectly elastic, in the case of the long-run supply curve is upward sloping, it is known as an **increasing cost industry**
- Potential entrants have higher costs than incumbent firms (already in the market)
- Some resources used in production may be available in limited quantities
	- Input prices rise as industry expends thus costs for all firms rise
- Congestion may rise with industry output
	- Airlines

## Decreasing-Cost Industry
Suppose that as output in an industry expands, costs for all firms fall
- Economies of scale in input markets
	- Example is computer software industry - As market expands the costs for all firms could actually fall
If the industry following a decreasing-cost in the long run, an increase in demand, will incur new entry will continue until no longer profitable that will create a new long-run equilibrium price that is lower than the initial equilibrium price
- In this case, the long-run industry supply curve is downward sloping, a **decreasing cost industry**
