## Background Information
- Consumer behavior -> demand for goods & services
- We examine consumer behavior assuming each customer  tries to **maximize** their **well-being** 
- **Competitive Markets**
	- Where the choices of individuals consumers do not affect the price in the market
	- Consumers are **price takers**
	- There are many sellers in the market


## Benefit and Willingness to Pay
- A consumer derives some benefit from consuming a particular good or service
- The benefit a consumer gets is also their **willingness to pay** (WTP)
	- The maximum price a consumer will pay for a good is equal to the benefit they anticipate getting from the item

## Total Benefit and Marginal Benefit
- When a consumer buys multiple units of a good, important to distinguish between **total** and **marginal** benefit
	- Candice's WTP for coffee is $4 for the first cup, $3 for the second cup, $2 for the third
		- Her total benefit is $9
		- Her marginal benefit is first $4, then $3, then $2
- **When dealing with Marginal benefit, we expect that the marginal benefit to decline with each additional unit consumed**
- When the consumer buys many units of a good, typically to have a continuous Marginal Benefit (MB) curve

## Individual Demand

We can use a consumer's Marginal Benefit curve to find his individual demand curve

The **individual's demand** is the quantity of a good or service that a consumer is willing and able to buy at a certain price
- An individual demand curve traces the combinations of:
	- Price of good
	- Individual demand at that price
	- Holding everything else constant

The maximum price a consumer will pay for a good is equal to the benefit they anticipate getting from the item

A consumer will purchase units of goods up to Price <= Marginal Benefit, but **why?**

In a rational customer,
- If the Price < Marginal Benefit for a unit of good, the consumer should buy that unit because the WTP for that unit exceeds the price
- If the price > MB for a unit, the consumer should not buy that unit because the WTP for that unit is less than the price
- If the price == marginal benefit, then the consumer can either buy or not

As a result, a consumer's **individual demand curve** is his/her **marginal benefit** curve
- Because marginal benefit is diminishing, the individual's demand curve is usually downward sloping
- A demand curve represents how much a consumer is willing / able to buy at different market prices

### Ice Cream Example

| Q   | Total Benefit | Marginal Benefit | Price = 3 | Marginal Price | Total Net benefit |
| --- | ------------- | ---------------- | ----- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| 1   |               |                  |   3    |      3          |                   |
| 2   |               |                  |   6    |        3        |                   |
| 3   |               |                  |   9    |        3        |                   |
| 4   |               |                  |   12    |        3        |                   |
| 5   |               |                  |    15   |       3         |                   |
| 6    |               |                  |   18    |       3         |                   |


## Law of Demand

The downward slope of the demand curve means that a consumer consumes fewer units when the price is higher

This negative relationship between price and quantity demanded is known as the law of demand
- A good that violates the law of demand is called a Giffen good

![[Pasted image 20230807120622.png]]
We can see that as the price is higher, the quantity able to be purchased (demand) is decreased

## Movement Along A Demand Curve

Recall: The demand curve is derived by assuming that only price and quantity can change

If there is a change in price or quantity, there will be a **movement along the demand curve**
- Movement downwards along the curve --> "Increase in the quantity demanded"
- Movement upwards along the curve --> "Decrease in the quantity demanded"

If there is a change in price,
- If the price decreases then we move down the curve --> "Increase in the quantity demanded"
- If the price increases then we move up the curve --> "Decreases in the quantity demanded"

![[Pasted image 20230807121550.png]]

Note: A "change in demand" is not the same as "change in quantity demand"
- Quantity demanded refers to a movement in the demand curve
- Change in demand refers to a shift in the demand curve


## Change in Demand
A demand curve is drawn assuming all **other relevant factors** are held constant
- These factors can include, income, taste, expectation, and the price of other goods

If any of these factors change, the demand curve itself will shift in or out

A shift of the demand curve is called a **change in demand**:
- If demand shifts to the right, this is called **increase in demand**
- If demand shifts to the left, this is called a **decrease in demand**

### Examples
Lets assume that coffee and muffin are eaten together. Lets say that the price of muffin increases, then the demand of muffin decreases due to the law of demand which causes a change in demand in coffee which is a shift to the left in the demand curve. This relationship between coffee and muffin is **complementary**

Lets assume that people would usually drink either coffee or milk tea. Lets say that the price of milk tea increases which causes the demand of milk tea to decrease. Because of this we can assume that the demand of coffee increase and cause a shift to the right in the demand curve. This relationship between coffee and milk tea is going to **substitute**
## Market Demand

**Recall:** An individual consumer's demand curve is given by his marginal benefit curve
- We can use this to derive the market demand curve

The **market demand curve** traces out combinations of (a) market price and (b) quantities that all consumers in a market are together willing and able to buy at that price
- Market Demand = Add up individual demand horizontally
- We add then quantities and leave the price as it is

We are often interested in demand at the market level 
	- We are not interested for the demand for individuals

This market demand curve can be derived by adding together the quantity demanded by each individual consumer at each price
- Suppose the market price of apple is $4 and there are just two consumers in the market
- At $4, Sonia is willing to buy 6 apples and Elizabeth is willing to buy 3 apples
- This means that $4, the total quantity demanded in the market is 9 apples
- We need to also check how much Sonia and Elizabeth would together be willing to buy apples at difference prices
- We add all the quantities together and then we can graph a curve

![[Pasted image 20230807123830.png]]

The law of demand still holds for the market demand curve and we can use the term **change in the quantity demanded** to refer movements along the demand curve and **change in demand** refer to a shift of the demand curve itself
