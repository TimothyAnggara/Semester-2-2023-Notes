## What determines Trade Patterns?
- **Comparative Advantage**
- Countries with the lowest opportunity cost of producing a good
	- Having a "Comparative advantage" in the good
	- Specialize in the production of the good
	- Export the good

- The price of each good in the presence of trade will be
	- TV - 0.5 to 2 Vacciness
	- Vaccine - 0.5 to 2 TVs

### Who benefits from trade?
- Consider what happens in the absence of trades - "Autarky" (Closed trade)
	- Domestics prices are determined by demand and supply
	- In turn determine producer and consumer surplus
	- Let's think about cars

- Now lets consider what happens in the presence of international trade
	- Comparative advantage determines whether we import or export cars
	- The world price is the price prevailing in world markets
	- Determined by world demand and supply

- We decide whether to import or export a good depends on comparative advantage or disadvantage, world price, and domestic price
	- If the domestic market is small and the domestic market and world market are competitive,
		- A comparative advantage occurs when $p_w > p_d$
		- A comparative disadvantage occurs when $p_w < p_d$
	- If our country has a comparative advantage in producing a good then we export that good
	- If our country has a comparative disadvantage in producing a good then we import that good

## Trade Barriers
- A tariff is a tax on a commodity produced abroad and sold domestically
	- Assume it raises price of imported goods above the world price by the amount of the tariff
- Import quota is a restriction on quantity of imports
- Other import restrictions include
	- Licensing requirement
	- Quarantine Restrictions
	- Costly port handling facilities and red tape
	- Domestic content requirements
	- Quality and performance standard
### Effects of a Tariff
- If we try and impose a tariff on cars, what would happen is that the market price will now be world price + tariff tax
