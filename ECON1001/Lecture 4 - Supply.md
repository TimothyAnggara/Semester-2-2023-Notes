## Economies of Scale
Economies of scale are the cost advantages that a business obtains due to expansion. 
- Factors that cause a producer's average cost per unit to fall as production is increased

Economies of scale is the portion on the long-run average cost curve when it is decreasing

- Constant Returns to Scale: ATC constant as plant size increases, here if we double all inputs, output will double too

Economies of scales comes from:
- Labor Specialization
When a large firm employs a large number of workers, this allows the firm to employ specialization onto its workers by splitting jobs into smaller task assigned to specific workers which will spend all their work time on the part they know best and allows them to hone their skills.
- Managerial Specialization
Firms may be able to lower average cost by improving the management structure within the firm
- Efficient Capital
Efficient machines and equipment have high production capacity but only large scale firms can afford such equipment and can benefit from it at their full capacity. Full utilization of machinery or equipment achieves lower production cost / unit
- Bulk-buying Products
Larger firms have more purchasing power thus being able to buy materials in bulk at discounted prices

## Diseconomies of Scale
As a firm increases its scale of output, Long-run Average Cost increases because:
- Duplication of effort - When a firm grows too large, it is inevitable that someone or a team will take on a project that is already being handled by another team
- Top-heavy companies - More employees a firm has, the larger the percentage of the workforce being "management", which does nothing other than manage thus productivity is being reduced
- Inertia - Unwillingness to change because "we've always done it that way"
- Cannibalization - Large firms frequently find their own products are competing with each other
- Inelasticity of Supply - Company which is heavily dependent on its resource supply will have trouble increasing production

## Returns to Scale and Economies of Scale
There is a direct relationship between returns to scale and economies of scale where the economies of scale reflect the relationship between output and cost
- Increasing returns to scale --> economies of scale / falling average cost of production
- Decreasing returns to scale --> Diseconomies of scale / Increasing average cost of production
- Constant returns to scale --> No economies or diseconomies of scale / average cost is constant

### Minimum Efficient Scale and Industry Structure
Minimum Efficient Scale is the smallest level of output at which the firm can minimize long-run-average costs

If we look at $q1$ and $q2$, we can see that
### Natural Monopoly
A market situation where unit costs are minimized by having a single firm produce the particular good or service.

We would expect the LRAC where economies of scale are extensive and diseconomies are remote
## Firm Supply
Lets focus on comparative markets with many buyers and sellers such that no individual buyer / seller has the power to materially affect the price in the market

This situations makes it so that both sellers and buyers are **price takers** and when firms are **price takers,** the **individual firm's supply function and market supply function** are determined by their **cost function**

- **Firm Supply** - output quantity that a firm is willing and able to supply at a certain price
- **Supply curve** - All combinations of (a) market price and (b) output quantities that a firm is willing and able to sell at that price
	- When we draw the supply curve, assume that only the price of output is changing, holding everything constant

A Marginal Cost often increases in quantities once above the AVC due to diminshing marginal product, thus the supply curve is increases

### Example
Jun is a creator on social media who earns money by making videos. Assume that Jun is a price taker and the **market price (P)** for each video is **$55** (marginal revenue)

| # of videos | Marginal Cost | Marginal Profit |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| 1           |20        | 55-20=35          |
| 2          |     30    | 55-30=25          |
| 3           |           40    | 55 - 40 =15               |
| 4           |               50|            55-50=5     |
| 5            |              60 |                55-60=-5 |
We can see that to maximize profit, Jun would only make at most 4 videos as:
- If P > MC, produce one more video
- If P < MC, produce one less video
- As we can see, a profit-maximizing firm increases its supply until it hits P = MC


### Movement Along the Supply Curve

A movement along the supply curve when output price changes is called "Change in quantity demanded"
- When the market price changes and no other relevant-factor changes
- A surge in respiratory infection has increased demand for masks thus increasing the market price for mask higher, this will result in an **upward movement along the supply curve**

### Shifts in Supply
If any factor other than price or quantity changes, the supply curve will shift

If there is a change in one of these factors there will be a "Change in Supply"
	- Increase in supply - shifts to the right
	- Decrease in supply - shifts to the left 

New technology has reduced production costs of mask which lowers marginal costs and resulting in the supply curve to shift to the right because it is more profitable to sell more masks at each given market price

## Market Supply
**Market supply curve** shows the quantity supplied in a market for at different market prices, holding everything else constant

The market supply curve is the horizontal summation of individual supply curves along the q-axis

Market = Firm 1 + Firm 2

Both firms supply positive quantities when price is above $\underline{p}$ and summing up two linear individual supply curves horizontally will result a market supply curve that is also linear
![[Pasted image 20230821213744.png]]
If two firms' individual supply curves have different starting points, summing up two linear individual supply curves horizontally, the market will  have a kink where when two firm's supply curve reach a price where both can contribute to the supply curves
![[Pasted image 20230821213914.png]]

The law of supply also holds for the market supply curve
- Quantity supplied increases in price
