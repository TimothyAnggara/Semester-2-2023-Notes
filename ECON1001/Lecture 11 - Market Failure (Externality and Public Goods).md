## Market Failure
- We have assumed that a perfectly competitive market is Pareto efficient
	- Resources are allocated in the most efficient way
	- Maximum surplus
	- Limited role for the government in the market
- Market Failure occurs when the market does not result in a Pareto efficient outcome even with competition
	- Produce the wrong amount of goods or services
	- Failure to allocate sufficient resource to the production of certain goods
	- Role for government to correct markets when market failures

### Externalities
- Cost or benefits to parties other than those in a transaction:
	- Pollution from a factory
	- Greenhouse gases
	- Education - Positive Externality
	- Immunization - Positive Externality
- An externality is an uncompensated impact of one person's action on the well-being of a bystander
	- Affected by air pollution due to a factory - negative
	- By getting a flu shot, you also give benefit to other people near you by providing herd immunity - positive

- The optimal level of externalities depends on the **marginal social cost and benefits**
	- In the absence of an externality, efficiency requires
		- MB = MC
- In the presence of an externality, the price in a competitive market reflects only **private** cost, not the cost to others

- The problem with externalities is that economic agents (consumers, producers) ignore them when they make decisions
- The efficient level now is where Marginal social benefit (MSB) = Marginal social cost (MSC)
	- Marginal Social Cost = Marginal Private Cost + Marginal External Cost = Supply curve
	- Marginal Social Benefit = Marginal Private Benefit + Marginal Social Benefit = Demand Curve

### Property Rights
- Why do externalities arise?
	- Lack of ownership, well-defined property rights, etc.
- Property rights is defined as "Rights individuals or firms have to exclusive use of their property, including the right to buy or sell it"
- In the absence of property rights, ownership of a river, polluters will not care how much pollution is dumped into it
#### Example
- A firm owns a sulphuric acid factory that discharges waste into the Cooks River
	- waste is duped into the river and is hazardous to fish
	- Think about the firm's MB curve of dumping waste
	- Think about the firm's MC curve of dumping waste
- A fishing club that uses the river:
	- Quality and quantity of fish decline with more waste

- The efficient outcome is not where MSB = MSC
	- In this scenario, there is no external benefit so MB = MSB = MPB
- Area B - DWL
	- 3 Points to consider,
		- The efficient point
		- The point in MSC where quantity produced is at $Q_c$
		- The point in MSB where quantity produced is at $Q_c$
## Coase Theorem
- Coase Theorem states:
	- Low transaction cost & complete property rights the efficient outcome will be achieved
	- Owner ensures that the 'polluter' compensates for their actions
### Property Rights and Coase Theorem
- There are two ways we could define property rights
	- The factory (polluter) 'owns' the river
		- Fishing club pays the factory to reduce their pollution
	- The club (victim) 'owns' the river
		- Factory pays the club to be allowed to pollute
- Does it matter who 'owns' the river?
	- Coase theorem states that it does not matter who the owns the river
- Limits associated with Coase theorem
	- Transactional costs
	- Distributional concerns
### Ways to Address Externalities
- Control and command
	- Regulate pollution for each firm
- Emission charges
	- Charge firms for each unit of pollution
- Taxes
	- Tax on each unit of output
- Marketable permits
	- Impose a limit on total pollution
	- Permits can be bought and sold in the market

When addressing with pollution, its important to ask what might the  problems be associated with putting each mechanism into place?
- How much pollution is optimal?
- For each firm? Overall?
- Can we actually create a market that will work?
- Is regulation feasible?
#### Pigouvian Tax
- Tax on the activity that generates the externality
- Bring the market to the socially optimal level of the activity
- Impose a tax on the activity equal to the level of the externality at the efficient level of output
	- The tax will charge the marginal external cost at $Q^*$

#### Marketable Permit Scheme
- Marketable permit scheme directly regulate the total quantity of pollution
- Assume that the optimal total of pollution is 10
- There are two types of firms that receive a 'license to pollute' of 5
	- One firm has relatively high abatement cost
		- Expensive to reduce pollution
	- Second firm has low abatement costs
		- Cheap to reduce pollution
	- Abatement cost = cost of reducing pollution
- In this scenario, firm 1 will buy some pollution license from firm 2

![[Pasted image 20231023123416.png]]
- The companies will buy and sell the permit until the marginal cost of abatement is equal in both firms
#### Advantages
- Pollution is reduced to regulated limit
- Reduction happens at the lowest cost
- Regardless of the initial distrbution across firms, firms will trade permits to achieve efficient outcome
#### Difficulties
- Determine the 'optimal' level of pollution so that a market is created
- Considered an external cost of production
## Public Goods
### Private and Public Good
- Private good have two characteristics
	- Rivalry in consumption
		- Consumption of the good or service by one person means that another person is not able to consume that good
	- Excludability
		- People can be prevented from consuming unless they pay for the good/service
- Public goods are:
	- Non-rival
		- One person's consumption does not detract from another person's ability to consume it
	- Non-excludable
		- Individuals cannot be excluded from consuming the good/service

#### Public Goods & The Free Rider Problem
- Public goods benefit many people because they are non-rivalrous
	- We can all consume the public good provided
- Public goods are non-excludable
	- Cannot force people to pay for them
- Leads to the free rider problem
	- Those who do not pay for public goods cannot be excluded from consuming them
		- This leads to underproduction

#### Provision of public Goods
- Because of this nature of public goods, private businesses would not be able to thrive and as a result public goods can be provided by taxes
- How much should a public good should the government provide?
	- Compare marginal social benefit with marginal social cost
	-
