## Introduction:
- The Firm
- Production Function
- Costs of Production
	- Short-run Costs
	- Long-run Costs

we will be focusing on how firm operates and how they behave with a view on understanding firm and market supply

We will also be examining the ideas of short and long run for a firm's production process and analyzing the relationship between a firm's inputs and their outputs, **production function**
- In the short run, the firm has at least one fixed input of production while in the long run all inputs can be adjusted if the firm wishes to

Lastly, we will examine how a firm's output is related to its costs in the short and long run

## The Firm
A firm is a organization that employs factors of production to produce or provides goods / services.

We can think firms as a production function:
`
$$
Y = AF(K,L)
$$
- A - Level of Technology
- F - Some function
- K - Capital
- L - Labor
	- We generalize labor in this function
- Y - Total output

Recall that a firm's goal is to maximize profit, in a **short-run**, it is a time frame where at least one of the variables in the production function is fixed while in the **long-run** all variables are not fixed.

Runs are not defined in a time frame, but how long would it take for all of a firm's inputs to be available
## Short-run Production Function
Assuming that L is variable and K and A is constant, based on the graph below we can see that:
- TPL - Total Production of Labor
- With small amount of labor, with more labor input, output increases very fast (increasing returns)
- With medium-high amount of labor, more labor input, output increases but slower
- With very large labor, more labor input, output decreases
We will discuss the bullet points below

### Average Product of Labor 
- APL
- Total output denoted as $Y$ or $Q$
- Average output each worker can produce
$$
\frac{Y}{L} = \frac{Q}{L}
$$
### Marginal Product of Labor
- MPL
- Additional output when employing one more worker
- MP is the slope of the production function
$$
	\frac{\triangle Q}{\triangle L} = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial L}
$$

![[Pasted image 20230814112712.png]]

We can see that when we increase labor in the beginning, our employees are **specializing** into specific roles and when we have too much labor, our total output rate slowly decreases which is a cause of the **law of diminishing returns**. We can see that as we have too much labor, our production decreases which is important.

![[Pasted image 20230814113118.png]]

We can see that the MPL cuts through the APL at the maximum APL because APL increases with MPL and APL decreases with MPL so it must cut through the maximum of the APL.
- When MPL > APL, average is increasing with L
- When MPL falls below APL, average is decreasing with L

### Law of Diminishing Returns (LDR)
**Law of Diminishing Return** states that as successive units of a  variable resource are added to a fixed resource beyond some point, the marginal product to each addition unit of the variable resource will decline

So why after some point $D$, from $D$ to $C$, output is going to increase at a decreasing rate?
- With fixed capital and technology, after point $D$, each worker will have less and less fixed capital to work with resulting in less efficient
- Crucially, diminishing MP is a short run concept, relying that at least one input (e.g. capital) is fixed

Note that output in maximum when the MPL == 0

## Productions in the Long Run (Returns to Scale)

In a long run, all inputs into the production process are variable and we are interested in how the quantity of output changes when we change the quantity of all of the factors of production

*Returns to scale* refers to how the quantity of output changes when there is a proportional change in the quantity of all inputs
- It is a long run phenomenon where all input are variable

Please note that *diminishing returns* is a short run phenomenon
- One input is fixed

If the output increases by the same proportional change, there are constant returns to scale
- If we double the inputs, the outputs will double as well

If output increases by more than proportional increase in all inputs, we have **increasing returns to scale**

If output increases by less than the proportional increase in all inputs, we have **decrease returns to scale**

Note: It is possible that a firm has diminishing MP in the **short run** and still have *increasing returns to scale* in the **long run**

## Production and Cost

The **production function** relates to *inputs and outputs* while a firm's **cost function** relates to the *total cost of production and output*

There is a **one-to-one relationship** between the production function and cost function, you can say that they '*tell the same story*'

We assume that firms aim to maximize profits, where profit = **Economic Profit**
- **Accounting profits** are revenues - all explicit cost
- **Economic Profit** are revenues - total opportunity cost

### Economic Profit

$$
Economic \space Profit = TR - TC
$$
- Total Revenue - amount a firm receives for the sale of its output
- Total cost: Amount the firms pays to buy the inputs of production + forgone opportunities
	- Total opportunity cost of producing goods / services
![[Pasted image 20230814121850.png]]
Opportunity cost includes explicit cost and implicit cost where:
- Explicit costs (that are not sunk)
	- Direct payments for inputs or factors of production
- Implicit costs (Value of foregone opportunities)
	- E.g. Forgone wages, interest earnings

Note: When revenues just cover opportunity cost, we can say that there is **Zero Economic Profit** or **Normal Profit**
## Short-run Costs
A **cost function** is an equation that links the quantity of output with its associated production cost
- $TC = f(q)$ where TC represents total cost and q represents the quantity of output

Recall that a short-run is the time frame where at least one of the factor of production is fixed

Total costs in a short run is the $Total \space Fixed \space Cost + Total \space Variable \space Cost$
- Total Fixed Cost - Costs that in total do not vary with changes in output
	- e.g. Rental payments, machine depreciation, etc.
- Total Variable Costs - Costs that change with level of output
	- E.g. materials, labor, fuel, etc.

### The Total Variable Cost and Total Cost Curve

At low level of output, the TVC and TC increase at a decreasing rate because, in the context as the example above, with 1 more labor, it will cost us 1 more labor, but our output increases so the total variable cost increase at a  decreasing rate.

At high level of output, TVC and TC increase at an increasing rate because in the context as the example above, with 1 more labor, it will cost us 1 more labor, but the rate of our output decrease so the total variable cost increases at an increasing rate

$$
Marginal \space Cost = \frac{\partial TC}{\partial Q} = \frac{\partial TVC}{\partial Q}
$$
$$
Average \ Fixed \ Cost = AFC = \frac{TFC}{Q}
$$
$$
Average \ Variable \ Cost = AVC = \frac{TVC}{Q}
$$
$$
Average \ Total \ Cost = AT
C = \frac{TC}{Q} = AFC + AVC
$$


### Relationship Between Average Total Cost, Average Variable Cost, and Marginal Cost

![[Pasted image 20230814123403.png]]

- AFC declines as Q increase because the total fixed cost stays the same while Q increases so the cost of fixed cost per unit decreases
- AVC declines initially, reaches a minimum and then increases again because initially, with increased production, the variable cost per unit decreases due to efficiency gains, but after a point LDR kicks in causing AVC to rise
- MC declines sharply, reaching a minimum and raises sharply again because of LDR. Adding more inputs can increase output efficiently but after a point, adding more results in less.
- Marginal cost cuts through the minimum of ATC and AVC because when MC is less than ATC, it pulls the average down an when the MC is higher than the ATC it pulls the average up
## Long-run Costs

All factors are variable in the long run so there are no fixed cost, all variable.

The firm can alter its plant capacity or capital and a firm producing a positive output has more flexibility to adjust all of its inputs, so long-run costs should not be more than short-run costs
- E.g. using more efficient technologies, using better factories, etc.

In a long run, the firm will choose the most efficient production method and the cheapest combination of all inputs

The long-run ATC shows the lowest per-unit cost at which any output can be produced after the firm has had time to make all appropriate adjustments in its size
- Depending on output, a firm will adjust its plant size and achieve the lowest per-unit cost
- Long-run average cost curve will be the lower envelope of all the short-run average cost curves
