### Characteristics of a Monopoly
- A market with a single seller:
	- Is a monopoly and that seller is a *monopolist*
	- One seller with many buyers
	- Because the monopolist is the only firm, it has **market power** to determine price in that market
		- The monopolist is a price marker
- Barriers to entry to potential entrants
	- Cost incurred by new entrants in the market but where the monopolist didn't have to bear in the past
	- Another barrier to entry are **legal** or **natural** constraints that protect a form from potential competitors

### Why Are There Monopolies?
The reasons why there are monopolies is because there are barriers to entry
- Competition and entry is restricted by various mechanisms including:
	- Legal Barriers to Entry
		- Exclusive rights over a goods production - Patents, Copyright
		- Public franchises / Government Licenses - Taxis, certificates to allow practice of medicine
	- Natural Barriers to Entry
		- Control over an essential input not available to other firms
			- Natural gas fields in Victoria
		- Monopolist may simply just have a lower cost of production that effectively allows them to prevent other firms from entering the market
			- Access to raw materials, favorable geographic location
		- Technology / level of demand makes one producer more efficient than a number of producers
### Natural Monopoly
A natural monopoly results from a situation where a single firm can supply an entire market at a lower cost than two or more firms could supply the market
- Examples:
	- Telecommunications network, Electricity transmission, tap water provision
- Characteristics of a Natural Monopoly
	- Declining (long run) average total cost implies natural monopoly
	- Substantial economies of scale
	- Often, large capital cost (infrastructure), but low marginal cost of supply

### Declining Average Costs
As output increases, average total cost of production decrease. Hence, a single firm can supply the market quantity at a lower cost than two individual firms supply 2 each

## What is Market Pawer?
- Monopoly is an industry comprised of a single firm
	- No close substitutes for the firm's product
	- Firm is protected from competition by some barriers to entry which prevents or inhibits entry of other firms
- In the absence of close competition
	- A monopolist has **market power**- Ability to affect price
- In a perfectly competitive firm, it is a price taker where its demand curve is perfectly elastic
![[Pasted image 20231006114851.png]]
- Having market power means that a firm that has a **LOW price elasticity of demand for its output** can raise price and not lose all its customers
	- Market power captures the idea that a firm can raise its prices above the level that would exist in a perfectly competitive industry and not lose all its customers
![[Pasted image 20231006113738.png]]
- A competitive firm has to take the price as determine in the market
	- No Market Power
	- Faces a perfectly elastic demand curve for its good
	- Marginal revenue = market price
- A monopolist is a price maker
	- Has market power
	- Downward-sloping D-curve for its good
	- Not only a monopolist has market power but whenever imperfect competition in market
		- e.g. where a few large firms dominate the market

## Monopoly Pricing Strategies
- Single-price monopolist - A firm that must sell each unit of output for the same price
	- Monopolist chooses quantity (thus price) to maximize profits
- Price discrimination - Practice of selling different units of a good or service for different prices
	- Haircuts, Movies, Utility Bills
	- Monopolist sets a variety of prices to maximize profits
### Single-Price Monopolist
- All customers pay the same price
- As the monopolist is the sole produces, it faces all demand in the market
	- Has a downward-sloping market demand curve
	- Has market power so it can raise prices and still have demand
	- Monopolist has to choose the price
- The monopolist can alter the price in the market by changing quantity
	- If produce more, price falls
	- If produce less, price rises
	- This causes a trade off for the monopolist
![[Pasted image 20231006120129.png]]
### Monopolist and Marginal revenue
- Marginal Revenue is the additional revenue that the firm received from selling one extra unit of a good
- Marginal revenue incorporates two effects:
	- Output effect: As you sell more units, you obtain extra revenue from the additional unit sold
	- Price effect: As you sell more units, the price falls and lose revenue on existing units sold
- Hence, MR is not the same as market price
	- MR is always below P
- In a firm in a competitive market, the marginal revenue is always equal to the market price
![[Pasted image 20231006120621.png]]

## Deriving Marginal Revenue from Monopolist's Demand Curve
- MR is the change in total revenue when the firm sells one more unit
	- We can obtain MR by differentiating TR **with respect to q**:
$$
MR = \frac{\partial{TR}}{\partial{q}}
$$
- Example: Consider when the demand curve is linear and given by: $P = a -bq$
	- For a monopolist, price is equal to average revenue so: $AR = a-bq$
	- To get total revenue we multiply AR by q: $TR = aq - bq^2$
	- From TR, we can find calculate MR by differentiating: $MR = \frac{\partial{TR}}{\partial{q}} = a - 2bq$
- Note two things about MR when demand is a straight line:
	- MR has the same vertical intercept as the demand curve at $a$
	- MR is linear with **twice the slope of the demand curve**

## Monopoly and Profit Maximization
- Profits will be maximized for a monopolist when a monopolists sets marginal revenue equal to marginal cost:
$$
MR = MC
$$
- If MR > MC, the monopolist can increase its profit be selling one extra unit
- If MR < MC, profit falls from selling that last unit, so it would be better off not selling tha tunit

- Notice the differences:
	- For a competitive firm: $P = MR = MC$
		- Competitive produce until $P = MC$
	- For a monopolist: $P > MR = MC$
		- Monopolist produce until $MR = MC$

### Monopoly Profits
The monopolist's profits is
$$
Profit = TR - TC = (TR/q - TC/q)\times q
$$
- Note that 
	- $TR/q = AR$ 
		- $TR = P \times q$
		- $P = TR/q$
		- $AR = TR/q$
	- $TC/q = ATC$
- Hence,
$$
Profit = (P - ATC) \times q
$$
- $(P-ATC)$ is the profit per unit sold
- $q$ is the quantity sold
![[Pasted image 20231006122829.png]]

### Note that it is also possible for monopolist to make a lost
- If their ATC curve is higher than the maximizing price
![[Pasted image 20231006122839.png]]

## Welfare / Efficiency With a Monopoly
- Socially efficient level of output is where the marginal value to consumers (MB) equals the marginal cost of production (MC)
	- MB = MC: All gains from trade are exhausted
		- Pareto Efficient
	- Welfare (total surplus) maximum and the competitive will output $Q^*$
- monopolist produces where $MR = MC$
	- We know that for every level out output: $MR < MB$ or $MR < P$
		- Hence this means that the monopolist restricts output to $Q^m < Q^*$
	- As a result, the result surplus is not maximized
- Using its market power, a monopolist can create a wedge between consumer's WTP and the producer's cost
	- A deadweight loss result
#### Maximum Welfare in Perfect Competition
![[Pasted image 20231006123421.png]]
#### Welfare loss of Monopoly
![[Pasted image 20231006123443.png]]
## Deadweight Loss
- Total loss in total surplus compared to the efficient outcome $Q^*$
- Monopoly cause a deadweight loss because it reduces output from socially efficient level $Q^*$
	- Higher prices transfer surplus from consumers to producers
	- Higher prices reduces output which will cause deadweight loss
- A possible additional loss of monopoly is rent seeking behavior
	- e.g., bribing politicians to maintain government monopoly
		- Say a company gets an addition $10 million profit due to the nature of a monopoly market, they will use the $10 million for rent seeking behavior 
			- Rent seeking behavior in this case means they are willing to spend $10 million to keep their monopoly power

### Monopoly and Perfect Competition
| Perfect Competition                 | Monopoly                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A price Taker                       | Influences Price (Price Maker)                                            |
| Produce where P = MC                | Produce where MR = MC                                                     |
| P = MR = MC                         | P > MC; P > MR                                                            |
| No barriers to entry                | barriers to entry                                                         |
| No economic profits in the long run | Restricts output, chargers a higher price, hence can earn economic profit |

### Example of a Monopoly Problem
Calculate the monopolist's price, quantity, profit, and DWL
- Demand: $Q = 10 - \frac{p}{2}$
- Costs: $MC = 5 + Q$
![[Pasted image 20231006173807.png]]
- $P = 20 - 2Q$
- $P\times Q = (20-2Q)Q$
- $TR = 20Q - 2Q^2$
- $MR = 20 - 4Q$
- Finding price and quantity:
	- $MR = MC$
	- $20-4Q = 5+Q$
	- $15 = 5Q$
	- $Q = 3$
	- $P = 20 - 2(3)$
	- P = 14
- $Profit = TR - TC = (P-ATC)\times Q$
	- TR = $14 \times 3 = 42$
	- TC = $\int{MC} = \int{5+Q} = 5Q + Q^2/2$
	- Profit = $42 - 5(3) - 3^2/2$ = 22.5
- Finding DWL
	- We need to find the triangle which has the points 
		- P = MC
		- Marginal Cost curve when Q = 3
		- Demand curve when Q = 3
	- P = MC
		- $5 + Q = 20 - 2Q$
		- 3Q = 15
		- Q = 5
		- P = 20 - 10
		- P = 10
	- Marginal Revenue Price when Q = 3
		- MR = 20-4(3)
		- MR = 8
	- Demand curve cost when Q = 3
		- P = 20-2(3)
		- P = 14
	- So, we know all the points, we can now use the area of a triangle formula to find DWL
		- Base = 14 - 8 = 6
		- Height = 5 - 3 = 2
		- Area of Triangle = (6 * 2) / 2 = 6
## Public Policies Towards Monopolies
Because monopolies create dead weight losses, government may want to regular monopolies and it usually does so by increasing competition in monopolized industries 
- Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
	- Cartels (Price-fixing agreements) illegal
	- Oppose Mergers
	- Misuse of Market Power
- Price Regulation
	- Regulate price of a monopolist
	- Two basic forms: 
		- MC-price regulation
		- ATC-price regulation
#### Marginal Cost Price Regulation
- Under the marginal-cost price regulation, the government sets the monopoly price at $P = MC$
	- Let us assume constant MC for simplicity
- The reason we set P = MC is because it will yield a pareto-efficient outcome
	- DWL = 0
- However, this means that the monopolist makes an economic loss equal to the grey-shaded area and will exit the market when it can
- To prevent this, government will need to subsidize the monopolist that amount to prevent them from leaving the market
![[Pasted image 20231006175517.png]]
### Average-Cost Price Regulation
- The government sets the monopoly price at $P = ATC$
- Monopolist will produce less than the efficient quantity so there is still some DWL but this regulation decreases DWL relative to the situation with no regulation
![[Pasted image 20231006175947.png]]
### Public Policies
- Problems with Price Regulation
	- MC pricing: Marginal cost pricing monopolist makes a loss and monopolist requires a subsidy
	- ATC Pricing: Monopolist earns zero profit but there is DWL in the market
- Public ownership
	- Can be difficult to implement
	- Public ownership alters incentives for managers
